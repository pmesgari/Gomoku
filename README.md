#Gomoku

![gomoku](gomoku.png)

This repository contains an implementation of Gomoku game. The main goals for creating this application were:

- Developing an application by exercising **Test Driven Development** (TDD)
- Implementing a clean architecture where modules are decoupled in such a way that 
as the application grows the base can adapt easily
- Having some fun while learning!

To really understand the main concepts underlying the logic and architecture of this repository
the reader is advised to study the articles below:

- [Gomoku Part 1: Understanding the Game, Setup and Base](https://pmesgari.github.io/techhighlands/article/gomoku-1)
- [Gomoku Part 2: Understanding the Geometry and Win Algorithm](https://pmesgari.github.io/techhighlands/article/gomoku-2)
- [Gomoku Part 3: Understanding the Architecture and Decisions Made](https://pmesgari.github.io/techhighlands/article/gomoku-3)
